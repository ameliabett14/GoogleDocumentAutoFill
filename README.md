# GoogleDocumentAutoFill
This will allow you to create all of your Google Documents from a template using a spreadsheet as a data processor, keeping things nice and stylized.

Paste appscript.js into a Google Sheet, and input your fields for Destination Folder, Template, and variables you plan on replacing.

In the example script, there were 7 fields of required information. This may change based on your variables. You should create a sample document in Google Drive that maps out the fields that will be replaced to each column. Give the unique identification (which I often encourage in brackets).

This will loop through each of the files in your range and create those documents. By adding it to your toolbar, you can also disperse the tool to your team allowing others to create templates!
